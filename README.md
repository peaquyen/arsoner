# ARSONER (2D)

> Arsoner is an action-adventure game. The game draws strong inspiration from adventure titles like Legend of Zelda, Pokemon, and Undertale. You control the character Tuk as he explores a small world within the hollow trunk of a tree, where the elements of the tree have been replaced by tiny inhabitants with the common ideal of self-evolution, resilience, and intelligence. To scratch the surface between these creatures, Tuk and his friends have built a force, ready to confront any other malicious forces.
